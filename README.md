#### Stocks analysis and prediction using lstm

In this notebook I will be looking exploring 6 stocks 'MTAANG' from NASDAQ 100, I will use pandas to get stock information from yahoo finance, and seaborn/ matplotlib to produce visualizations, I will conlude with risk analysis and with previous performance history, I will be predicting future prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

    2.) Moving Averages [10, 20, 50]
    3.) Average Daily Return
    4.) Are theses tocks correlated?
